You can run only failed test cases explicitly without any code. This can be easily done by running one simple testng-failed.xml

Steps:

    If your test cases are failing then once all test suite completed then you have to refresh your project .
        Right click on project
        Click on refresh or
        Select project and press f5.

    Check test-output folder,
        at last, you will get testng-failed.xml

    Now simply run testng-failed.xml

Updated after knowing version used is 6.9.10

    Version you are using is having open issues
    Due to that issue testng-failed.xml itself is not generated properly

Work around -

    Can you try 6.9.11-SNAPSHOT? Its working for me
    You can force your TestNG eclipse plugin to start using the TestNG jar available in your CLASSPATH by doing the following :
        Project > Properties > TestNG > Use project testng jar
    Uncheck that option & run the tests with 6.9.11-SNAPSHOT in my pom.xml

Please crosscheck once. Hope it helps you!
